### Homework on QR Code

Your employer learned about QR code and wants you to add a feature to your program, so that it reads and writes QR code.

Find a web page with at least one of these:
* more information about QR code
* application areas of QR code
* QR code reader/writer
* java API for QR code

This will be the basis of CW6 next week. -- Reference: [wikipedia article on QR_code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
